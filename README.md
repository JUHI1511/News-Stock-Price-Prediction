# News-Stock-Price-Prediction
# Aim
The principle focus of our project is to perform data cleaning and data analysis and train a
machine learning model using the most popular Machine Learning algorithm –Random Forest
in order to analyse the News data and predict the stock trend movements.
# Abstract
The prediction of stock prices in the market has always been an important task. However, due to the
market volatility, it is difficult to make the correct prediction solely based on historical stock data.
Therefore, in this project, with the analysis of daily news’ impact on stock markets, we identify some
key features that could be useful in stock price prediction and propose a machine learning model to
capture the dynamics of stock price trend with rich news textual information.
